## Criteria

The final report will be evaluated according to these criteria, and weights:

+-----------------------------+----------+
|Criterion                    |Max Points|
+=============================+==========+
|Readability, Structure, Order|10        |
+-----------------------------+----------+

|Problem Description and Analysis.

- Describe the problem you are trying to solve?
- What are the main requirements?
- What do you need to investigate further before proposing a solution?
- Discuss/Analyze/Conclude
</span>

15

Design exploration and presentation of solution.

- Evaluate a couple of different alternatives
- Present the architecture of the proposed solution/design.
- Analyze/Estimate performance and area

- Discuss/Analyze/Conclude


20

Verification plan (and verification done)

- Write a verification plan.
- What metrics will you use to decide when you are done verifying?
(pass rate, code coverage, functional coverage).
- Demonstrate the use of assertions
- What bring up test strategy have you planned?
- Discuss/Analyze/Conclude



20

Synthesis and test on FPGA

- Measure area and performance

- Prove that the design actually works on FPGA

- Discuss/Analyze/Conclude


20

Discussion

- Analysis and discussion of problems, solutions and measured results is necessary in order to make the right decisions. Discussion should therefore be integrated into all parts of the report.

- What is done, what can be improved (future work).
