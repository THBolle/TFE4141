Bitvis Utility Library - Overview on Versions and Changes
==============================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.6.0
----------
Released: 2015-08-24

All changes should be backwards compatible within 2.x.x
- Updated quick reference with default values for optional parameters.
- Added new alert level, NO_ALERT. Any alert with this alert level will be ignored.
- Added file selection for logs. The log() and log_text_block() procedures now accept
  arguments defining where to write the message (console and log file, console only
  or log file only), and what file name to write to (when applicable).
- Added Message ID ID_BFM_POLL. Used inside a BFM when polling until reading a given 
  value, i.e., to show all reads until expected value found.

v2.5.1
----------
Released: 2015-06-17

All changes should be backwards compatible within 2.x.x
- Fixed memory leak in log procedure.
- Fixed clock_generator procedure to comply with Riviera-PRO.
- Improved performance of enable_log_msg function.
- Cleaned up Modelsim project file.

v2.5.0
----------
Released: 2015-06-01

All changes should be backwards compatible within 2.x.x
- Added new procedure await_stable().
- Added deprecation procedure. This procedure is used to print a deprecation message for outdated procedures. The deprecation messages can
  be enabled/disabled by changing the C_DEPRECATE_SETTING constant adaptations_pkg. The constant changes the deprecation message printing
  globally for all applicable sub-programs.
- Normalise():
  - Parameters value and target can not have a length of zero. Added a check for this.
  - Fixed bug in overload for signed type.
  - This procedure has been replaced by normalize_and_check(). The functionality is exactly the same, only the name has changed. A 
    deprecation message will be printed for normalise() once for every simulation.
- Added randomize(). This is a replacement for randomise(), but randomise() is still included for legacy use. A deprecation message will be
  printed for randomise() once for every simulation.
- Added option for enabling the printing of alerts on a single line. The option is controlled by the boolean constant C_SINGLE_LINE_ALERT 
  in adaptations_pkg. Disabled by default.
- Added option for enabling the printing of log messages on a single line. The option is controlled by the boolean constant 
  C_SINGLE_LINE_LOG in adaptations_pkg. Disabled by default.
- Added optional QUIET/NON_QUIET parameter to disable_log_msg method.
- Fixed to_string bug which caused error when using one bit slv and signed.
- Added logging support for text blocks (VHDL line) through log_text_block().
- Added new Ids for larger headers (ID_LOG_HDR_LARGE and ID_LOG_HDR_XL).
- Moved C_LOG_HDR_FOR_WAVEVIEW_WIDTH from adaptations_pkg to types_pkg, and increased default from 50 to 100.
- Added replace procedures for string and line type. These procedures will replace a given target character with a given exchange 
  character.

v2.4.2
----------
Released: 2015-03-27

All changes should be backwards compatible within 2.x.x
- Changed method of deleting libraries in compile scripts in order to make them platform independent.

v2.4.1
----------
Released: 2015-02-18

Released for Jim Lewis and OSVVM interfacing checks only
All changes shuld be backwards compatible within 2.x.x
- Added function: is_log_msg_enabled()


v2.4.0
----------
Released: 2015-02-06

All changes shuld be backwards compatible within 2.x.x
- Removed copyright and license info from simulation (Moved to elaboration)
- Added Optional initial info on Library and last updates - for novices (mat be switched off via adaptations_pkg.vhd)
- Added some new UVVM IDs and modified som Library internal IDs
- Added ID-specific message indentation. Can be used by anyone, but primarily intended for UVVM to improve readability
- Added optional scope parameter to several methods to make library more consistent - especially for larger systems
- Added optional message and scope parameter to some methods to make library more consistent - especially for larger systems
- Added '\r' as a special character for strings to messages (log/alert).
  Same as '\n', but \n shifts only the message field one line down, whereas \r inserts a complete blank line
- Improved check_value(): Better mismatch report format
- Added string methods:
  - new functions pos_of_leftmost(), pos_of_rightmost()
  - new function get_string_between_delimeters()
  - new function get_procedure_name_from_instance_name()
  - new function get_process_name_from_instance_name()
  - new function get_entity_name_from_instance_name()
  - new function remove_initial_chars()
  - new overload for function to_string(string) -- return string with only valid ascii characters
- Modified compile scripts to remove library directory rather than using vdel - as vdel does not work between Modelsim versions
- Additional minor changes and cosmetic fixes.
- Added fix_vmap script into the compile script to handle a bug with vmap on linux
- Added overload for check_value where we compare boolean to boolean

v2.3.0
----------
Released: 2014-08-15

- Added new functions: gen_pulse() and clock_generator()
- Reduced initial license header
- Included powerpoint presentations for making good testbenches and using the library

v2.2.1
----------
Released: 2014-03-14

- Fixed mismatch between procedure declaration in header and body
- Modelsim scripts: changed default vhdl version to vhdl2008

v2.2.0
----------
Released: 2014-01-26

- Added new function: ascii_to_char() and char_to_ascii()
- Added to the message that is logged when test bench is stopped due to an alert

v2.1.1
----------
Released: 2013-10-28

- Bugfix: the to_string(signed) function did not handle negative numbers when converting from signed to decimal: to_string(my_signed, DEC)


v2.1.0
----------
Released: 2013-09-25

Note to users:
- If you use custom compile scripts,
  you must change the Bitvis_Util source
  directory name from src to src93, src2002 or src2008,
  depending on which VHDL version you compile for.

General:
- Added support for vhdl2008.
- Made a separate source directory for each vhdl version: src93, src2002 and src2008
  The user must choose which of these src directories to compile
- New compile scripts, in order to be able to choose between using the vhdl93, vhdl2002 or vhdl2008 version
- report_alert_counters() may now be called with an argument:
  - INTERMEDIATE = Print alert counters only
  - FINAL        = Print counters and print simulation conclusion (Success/Fail)
                   Typically call with FINAL from the end of the test sequencer

New features:
- Added new random functions and procedures: random sl and time

v2.0.0
----------
Released: 2013-08-09

General:
Major modifications to make a vhdl'93 compatible version, and at the same time maintain a 2002
compatible version to allow 100% safe update of shared variables. To minimise the differences
all protected variables that are not functionally needed for safe behaviour have been changed
into ordinary shared variables - for instance when only a single process is allowed to modify
a shared variable and no critical interaction between modification and a pure read.

Common changes for vhdl'93 and 2002:
- Type changes (Note: Changes related to this type changes are not listed explicitly)
  - from protected to normal shared - with corresponding name change
  - shared_initialised_util
  - shared_msg_id_panel
  - shared_log_file_name_is_set
  - shared_alert_file_name_is_set
  - shared_warned_time_stamp_trunc
  - shared_alert_attention
  - shared_stop_limit
  - shared_log_hdr_for_waveview
  - shared_seed1
  - shared_seed2
  - t_attention has been replaced by t_attention, which has a new litteral 'EXPECT'
(Litteral COUNT has been replaced by REGARD, as they are all really counters)
  -  Replaced protected methods in 'methods' by standard functions defined in a new package
  'vhdl_version_layer' with functions to access protected or standard shared depending
  on compatibility requirements. Hence there are two file versions of 'vhdl_version_layer'.

  - Added message IDs
  - ID_VVC_CONSTRUCTOR
  - Some internal functionality has been modified or removed. Not visible for users.
  - Improved some alert messages
  - Fixed wrong order of scope and msg in alert calls in normalise-procedures

  Changes NOT common for vhdl'93 and 2002:
  - vhdl_version_layer split into vhdl_version_layer_93 and vhdl_version_layer_2002
  - vhdl93: Substituted protected alert counter with ordinary shared variable.


  v1.0.0
  ----------
  Released: 2013-04-09
  First open source version.
  Hence no change history
(A list of changes from previous commercial versions is available for existing Bitvis Utility Library customers)
